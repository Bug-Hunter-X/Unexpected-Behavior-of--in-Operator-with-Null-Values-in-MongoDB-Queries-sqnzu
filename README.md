# Unexpected Behavior of $in Operator with Null Values in MongoDB Queries

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator and null values. The `$in` operator, when used with an array containing `null`, doesn't always behave as expected.  This can lead to incorrect query results or errors.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases an example where a query using `$in` with an array including `null` returns unexpected results.  This is a subtle issue that might not be immediately apparent.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses the unexpected behavior.  Instead of directly including `null` in the array, it checks for `null` explicitly using a separate condition or employing alternative strategies such as the `$or` operator.
